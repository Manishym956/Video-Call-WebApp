# Video-Call-WebApp

A simple and interactive video-calling web application built using WebRTC. This app allows users to connect with others via video calls directly in their browser. You can also connect to the call using your mobile phone by exposing your local server to the internet using `ngrok`.

---

## Features
- **Real-time video calls**: Connect with others using WebRTC.
- **Multi-tab support**: Test the app by opening multiple tabs in your browser.
- **Mobile support**: Share the call link with your mobile phone or friends.
- **End call button**: Easily disconnect the call.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) (for installing `ngrok` on Windows)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) (for exposing your local server to the internet)

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application
Start the development server:
```bash
npm run start
```
- The app should automatically open in your browser at `http://localhost:9000`.
- If it doesnâ€™t open automatically, manually navigate to `http://localhost:9000` in your browser.

## Testing the Application

### 1. Multi-Tab Testing
1. Open two tabs in your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9000` in both tabs.
2. Enter a username in both tabs and click **Create**.
3. In the contact list, click the **phone button** next to the username to initiate a call.
4. The two tabs will connect via video call.
5. Use the **End Call** button to disconnect.

### 2. Mobile Testing
1. **Install ngrok** (if not already installed):
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
     ```bash
     choco install ngrok
     ```
2. **Authenticate ngrok**:
   - Run the following command in PowerShell:
     ```bash
     ngrok config add-authtoken 2uAXjKTFL8luLFHYzu2pu0N58ri_3JP6ZNLu2o1KXnwHpp9TN
     ```
3. **Expose your local server**:
   - Run the following command in PowerShell:
     ```bash
     ngrok http http://localhost:9000
     ```
   - Copy the `ngrok` link (e.g., `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io`) from the terminal.

4. **Share the link**:
   - Open the `ngrok` link on your mobile phone or share it with friends.
   - Enter a username and click **Create** to join the call.

5. **Keep the server running**:
   - Ensure the PowerShell window running `ngrok` remains open while testing.
